- split the code into separate files:
	- tests + main
	- protocol lib
	- mocks
	such that the protocol lib can be used separately
- get it to compile & run with Xcode and get the debugger to work
- create classes for the reader and writer?
- implement writer, which can be seen as a proxy, as a subclass of the ColorDuino class? 
- tests should check byte length of generated commands
- use a real unittest lib
- find an elegant way to define opcodes
- test reader and writer separately?
