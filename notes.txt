ColorDuino musings
==================

- direct connect only to Uno (5v, 500mA/channel, requires a lot of pins)
- Uno will still have I2C pins and/or serial-over-usb available
- use EEPROM to store current state
	- 1024 kB: either
		- animation of 5 frames + 64 bytes of control data (1 frame = 8*8*3 bytes using 8-bit pwm per color)
		- ..
		
- font glyphs part of program (PROGMEM data written in flash)
- keep RAM free for running the program
- whitebalancing using special registers. how?

- character mode
	- display 1 character at the time:
		char+r+g+b = 4bytes
	- global settings
		- speed
		- ..

- direct control via I2C
	- max 400000kHz (bits)
	- a single frame = 8*8*3 = 192bytes
	- 1000ms * (192*8 bits) / 400000bps = 3.84 ms per frame (considerably less then the 16.67 max for 60fps )
